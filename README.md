# Heart Attack Risk Prediction Using Retinal Fundus Images

## Overview
Academic project focused on predicting heart attack risk from retinal fundus images
using CNN-based deep learning architectures.

## Problem Statement
Early detection of cardiovascular risk using non-invasive retinal imaging.

## Approach
- Used CNN-based architecture (EfficientNet-B0)
- Applied image preprocessing and normalization
- Evaluated model performance using classification metrics

## Tech Stack
- Python
- CNN
- EfficientNet-B0
- OpenCV (conceptual)
- NumPy, Pandas

## Results
- Achieved reliable classification performance on test data
- Demonstrated feasibility of retinal images for risk prediction

## Limitations
- Academic dataset size
- No clinical deployment
- Code not included in this repository

## Repository Contents
- Project report (PDF)
- Architecture and evaluation documentation
